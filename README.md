# Fibonacci-Number

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones (from Wikipedia).  The sequence appears as follows:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,...

The 0th number of the series(f0) is 0, f1=1, f2=1, f3=2, etc.
